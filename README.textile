h1. Large Data and Clojure: the middle ground between RAM and EC2

In this talk I'll discuss techniques I have learned for working with large data
sets, which are too large to fit in RAM, but not so large you need distributed
computing to work with them.  I'll discuss things like: taking random samples;
finding duplicated values as well as other types of basic analysis.' 


Though not specific to Clojure, many of the techniques lead to elegant, easy to
understand implementations in Clojure by leveraging it's sequence abstraction
as well as other aspects of the language
