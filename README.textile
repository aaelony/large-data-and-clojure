h1. Large Data and Clojure: the middle ground between RAM and EC2

In this talk I'll discuss techniques I have learned for working with large data
sets - those which are too large to fit in RAM, but not so large you need
distributed computing to work with them.  I'll discuss things like: taking
random samples; finding duplicated values as well as other types of basic
analysis.' 

Though not specific to Clojure, many of the techniques lead to elegant, easy to
understand implementations in Clojure by leveraging it's sequence abstraction
as well as other features of the language.

Come hear about some new gadgets to add to your data munging utility belt!

h2. How to Win the Random Sample Turkey Shoot

You have been asked to take a random sample of a few hundred million records in
order to estimate some metrics of the data set as a whole.

  [ dice and a turkey ]

h3. I Know: the database!

  SELECT * FROM some_table ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 1000

  [ HUGE red X ]

BZZT! You just wasted time fixing the other guy's data export errors, then you
wasted time importing the data into your database only to find that the above
query is estimated to take somewhere between two days and the heat death of the
universe to execute on your workstation.

  [ a clock face and a DB cylinder ]

h3. I'll use the 'GNU Signal!'

  [ Bat-signal-like spotlight shining a huge GNU onto clouds? ]

Turns out you can, sort supports a 'random' flag:

  sort -R

This is faster than the database...

  uses up disk space on the order of your original data set [wasteful]
  lots of IO spent computing the output

   [ unhappy anthropomorphic database ]

h3. "You Shall Not Pass!" (multiple times)

"Selection without replacement"
Stream the data:
  odds are N/M of picking an element
  N is your desired sample set size
  M is the size of the population you haven't yet considered

Decrement M after considering each member of the population

Decrement N after you've chosen an element.

Sit back and bask in the Win.

 [ relaxed person?  the Reddit meme paint drawing / person? ]

One Machine, One Pass over the file, output on the order of your sample set
size.  The very definition of W.I.N.  (Why did I Not think of that before)

h2. That Was My Hook...

I was advised to tell you something valuable in the first few minutes of the
talk by a good friend of mine: Jonny Tran.  I hope that counts...

h2. What do I mean by 'Large Data'?

When your data set, or the information you need to track to analyze it, fits
into RAM, you can effectively ignore most of these techniques.  Finding
duplicated values in an array that already fits in memory is simple: you
iterate through it keeping a table of the times you've seen each element.  At
worst (no duplicates), you'll use memory on the order of the size of the data
set, plus the storage space it takes to store the count (an integer).

h3. Just Keep a HashMap/Table

  [ HUGE red X ]

BZZT!

Remember: too big for RAM, possibly way to big.

h3. Next Utility Belt Gadget: Bloom Filters

h3. What's a Bloom Filter

h3. Find likely Dupes in 1 pass

  Emit anything that's a HIT with the Bloom Filter.

  You'll get Some false positives.

  This is good enough for many of my use cases.


h3. Find Actual Dupes / Counts in 1 Pass

  Use a HashMap to count the elements that are a hit.

  Dump anything that has a count > 1 when you're done.


h3. Bonus: use proxy keys, not just natural keys

  You can compute a value on the data before testing it vs the bloom filter.

h2. Records and Identity

  Identity within the file.

  Many of the dumps I receive have no persistent identifiers.

  Many have no relative identifiers!

  Give each record an ID.

  [ seq util that adds a counter to each record ]

  You can just count up from 1, or if you want to get fancy, use an LFSR.

h2. What's an LFSR?

  Linear Feedback Shift Register.

  Class of PRNG.

  Interesting subset: m-sequences (have maximal period)

  Binary Numbering System - but non-sequential (remember: a prng)

  Fast, easy to serialize, not a hash.

  Keeps adjacent records from being close based on ID.

  This is not an issue for software / machines: but may help humans looking at
  the data from assuming that IDs which are close have some meaning.

  [ seq util that adds an lfsr id to each record ]

h2. Cheap Indexing Outside the Database / Grouping Records

Random Access

  Really means ability to seek within the file, not really random.

  Not a Streaming / Sequencing interface, boo

  With a few Clojure functions over the indexes we can re-make an ordered
  sequence of records!
